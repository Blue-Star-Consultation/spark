          <h2>Project Vision</h2>
          <p>My goal is to faithfully recreate the iconic maps and gameplay of Left 4 Dead 2 while leveraging the
            power of
            UE5 to enhance the visuals and overall experience. All textures are being meticulously redone to
            keep
            the
            original style intact but with a fresh, modern look. While the core of the game will remain the
            same, I
            am
            considering the addition of new features to further enrich the experience, though that’s still in
            the
            planning stages.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>Current Focus</h2>

          <p>Right now, my primary focus is on remaking the maps. Each map is being carefully redesigned to
            maintain
            the
            beloved elements of the original while introducing improvements that take advantage of today’s
            <span class="decorator">technology</span>.
