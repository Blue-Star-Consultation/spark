                <p>My goal is to faithfully recreate the iconic maps and gameplay of Left 4 Dead 2 while leveraging the
                    power of
                    UE5 to enhance the visuals and overall experience. All textures are being meticulously redone to
                    keep
                    the
                    original style intact but with a fresh, modern look. While the core of the game will remain the
                    same, I
                    am
                    considering the addition of new features to further enrich the experience, though thatâ€™s still in
                    the
                    planning stages.</p>
